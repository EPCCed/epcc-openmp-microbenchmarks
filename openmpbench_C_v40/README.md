# Changes from Version 3.0 

1. Additional measurements
2. Improved control over parameter settings
3. Improved statistics 
4. Minor bug fixes 


 # Installation

 1. Clone the repository
 2. `cd openmpbench_C_v40`
 3. Edit the Makefile.defs as follows:
    * Set CC to the C compiler you wish to use (e.g. gcc pgcc icc xlc etc)
    * Set CFLAGS to any required C compiler flags to enable processing of 
      OpenMP directives (e.g. -fopenmp, -mp, -omp); standard optimisation is 
      also recommended (e.g. -O).
    * Set LDFLAGS to any required C linker flags
    * Set CPPFLAGS to any required flags to 
      make the C compiler invoke cpp on .c and .h files
    * Set LIBS to any flags for linking with required libraries. 
    

3. Type "make" to build all 4 benchmarks or "make benchmark" where benchmark 
    is one of syncbench, taskbench, schedbench. By default "make" will build 
    arrybench executables with array sizes ranging in powers of 3 from 1 to 59049. To 
    build the array benchmark with an array size of arraysize, use 
    "make IDA=arraysize prog" where arraysize is a positive integer. 


Example Makefile.defs.* files are supplied for GNU, Cray, AMD and Intel compilers


# Running

1. Set OMP_NUM_THREADS to the number of OpenMP threads you want to run with, 
   e.g. export OMP_NUM_THREADS = 4
   

2. Run the benchmark with:
   ./\<benchmark\> 

   The output will go to STDOUT and thus you will probably want to re-direct 
   this to a file. 
   
   ./\<benchmark\> -h will give the usage options. Available options are: 
	
	`--measureonly <selected measurement>`  (runs all by default) 
	
	`--outer-repetitions <outer-repetitions>` (default 20)
	
	`--test-time <target-test-time in microseconds>` (default 1000.00 microseconds)
	
	`--delay-time <delay-time in microseconds>` (default 0.1000 microseconds)
	
	`--delay-length <delay-length in iterations>` (default auto-generated based on processor speed)

# Additional notes


 1. If you encounter problems with the value of innerreps becoming too 
    large (an error will be reported) try recompiling with a lower level of 
    optimisation, ideally with inlining turned off. 

 2. It is common to observe significant variability between the overhead 
    values obtained on different runs of the benchmark programs. Therefore, 
    it is advisable to run each benchmark, say, 10-20 times and average the 
    results obtained.

 3. You should use whatever mechanisms are at your disposal to ensure that 
    threads have exclusive or almost exclusive access to hardware resources. You 
    should rejects runs where the standard deviation or number of outliers is 
    large.
